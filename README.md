<h3>What is Travelboard</h3>
<h4>Plan your trip</h4>

With our planner, you can schedule all your activities during your trip. You can fill each day with sightseeing while also scheduling accomodations, flights, bus and train connections. Don’t forget to add must-try cafes and restaurants! Drag and drop, play around. See your expenses for each particular day. It's an all-in-one planning tool!

<h4>Get inspired</h4>

Don’t know where to start? We get you covered! Use an integrated Google Map to find excursions, cafes and restaurants, plus local hotels and hostels. Found something worth a visit? Just push a plus button and it will magically appear in the container of your planner. Drag and drop to the calendar and you’re almost ready to go!

<h4>Be prepared</h4>

Last, but not least, make sure your have everything you need for your trip. Our extended packing list will help you not forget anything important. Finally get your finances under control in our budget tool. See your expenses per each category and calculate the total for the whole trip.

<h3>Technologies used</h3>
We built the app in 8 days in a team of 4 people. We used Node.js and MongoDB on server side and React on client side. For the maps and inspirations for restaurants, sites and hotels we used Google Maps API. For the design we used Material-UI React library.

<h3>Challenges</h3>

The most challenging was to not just add drag and drop feature to the planner but actually save a position of an activity every time the user moves it. Also working with external components from Material-UI React library was new to our team but gave us an opportunity to practice integration of React libraries and packages.
